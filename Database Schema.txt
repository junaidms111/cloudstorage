This schema allows for users to have their files organized into folders, with sharing permissions managed separately. 
Metadata can be used for additional details about files, such as tags or descriptions. 
Adjustments or additions may be needed based on specific features and requirements of the Google Drive-like project, 
such as versioning, trash management, and access control.
